## Welcome to Michael Dardour's Personal Production Journal

### Week 2
Michael Dardour, PPJ 1

Week 2 mainly consisted of getting my one and other group members git repositories and Unity versions in sync. (1hr)
Additionally I made comments about movement systems in other games such as Titanfall and how they could potentially be used as a basis of how Momentums system could perform.  (1.5hr)
Worked with Yash and Kendall mocking up the tech demo to show the player moving through a hexagonal grid with a basic environment. (2hr)


Positive: Got to brainstorm and bring up ideas 

Negative: Unity is finicky and had to spend way too much time trying to download the correct version

Total Hours: 4.5

### Week 3
Michael Dardour, PPJ 2

Spent time going over various ways of creating an easily accessible and scalable base character script which all enemies should derive from. Player character also derives from this script  (2hrs)

Took example sprites to show basic sprite interactions (2hr)

Discussions with other team members as to what characters should have certain attributes such as momentum. Eventually decided that the player is the only person with a Momentum Mechanic, however ideas of having a boss with momentum is still on the table (1hr)


Positive: Made a solid foundation for every character piece that will be implemented in the game. 
Negative: Unities method of doing sprite animations are tricky, and requires some workarounds to do basic things.

Total Hours: 5
