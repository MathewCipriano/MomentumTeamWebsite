## Welcome to Michael Dardour's Personal Production Journal

### Week 1
Week 2 mainly consisted of getting my one and other group members git repositories and Unity versions in sync. (1hr)
Additionally I made comments about movement systems in other games such as Titanfall and how they could potentially be used as a basis of how Momentums system could perform.  (1.5hr)
Worked with Yash and Kendall mocking up the tech demo to show the player moving through a hexagonal grid with a basic environment. (2hr)


Positive: Got to brainstorm and bring up ideas 

Negative: Unity is finicky and had to spend way too much time trying to download the correct version

Total Hours: 4.5
