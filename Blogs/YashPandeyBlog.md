## Welcome to Yash Pandey's Personal Production Journal

### Week 2
Yash Pandey PPJ 1

Tasks – Hours taken:
-	Infrastructure Set-up (Unity Hub, get correct unity version, set-up github)
o	1.5 Hours
-	Tech Demo (Pair Programming with Tech Demo Team, grid initialized, movement foundation laid, environment design)
o	1 Hour
Total Hours: 2.5 Hours

Positive: Were able to tackle some design questions and create the tech demo

Negative: The team’s schedule is very tight making it hard to meet up for meetings

Upcoming: Game Mechanics Design, Player Movement (and all the arithmetic related to it), Learn about Algorithm A* for figuring out AI mechanics

### Week 3
Yash Pandey, PPJ 2
Tasks – Hours taken:
-	Hex object with implementation of grid calculation references, grid generation script.
o	3.5 Hours
-	Standardized Hex Template using classes for laying the foundation for map generation (level design tool creation)
o	2.5 Hours
Total Hours: 6 Hours

Positive: Constructed Hex Class with future proofing for level generation, hex distance (between two points) and movement calculation trackers, etc. Also helped implementing the hex grid generation for creating the hex map

Negative: Difference in purpose for elements give rise to the need for further specification and discussion on details

Upcoming: Unit Movement, Unit Path Choosing (how to get from point A to point B)

### Week 4
Yash Pandey, PPJ 4
Tasks - Hours Taken:
- Highlight Hex function (along with refactoring and improving several structures)
o 5 Hours
- Integration of path decision between two points
o 2 Hours
- Creation of Mathematical Algorithms for Hex-based calculations
o 0.5 Hours
Total Hours: 7.5 Hours

Positive: Implementation of Hex Highlighting and modifications to Hex object for better clarification and build

Negative: Implementation, refactoring, and silly mistakes caused tasks to take a whole lot longer than expected. 

Upcoming: 
- Finishing of implementation of Hex movement
- Unit (player and enemy) generation and implementation to complete Game Loop
- Perhaps even taking a look at Map Generation to allow for a custom bias in the tiles that get used.
