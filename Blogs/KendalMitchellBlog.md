## Welcome to Kendal Mitchell's Personal Production Journal

### Week 1
Kendal Mitchell, PPJ 1
This week I worked on testing a variety of solutions to create our 5x5 hex gridboard and allow player movement. Initially, I was working with Unity's hexagonal grid and tile palette, 
we eventually shifted over to displaying hexagonal models made with ProBuilder to ease our efforts later down the road for procedurally generating maps.
I researched the A* algorithm for pathfinding and assisted in paired programming for our technical demo. Additionally, I also created a main menu for the game.
