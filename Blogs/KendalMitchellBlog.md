## Welcome to Kendal Mitchell's Personal Production Journal

### Week 2
Kendal Mitchell, PPJ 1

Tasks Done: 

This week I worked on testing a variety of solutions to 

* Create our 5x5 hex gridboard
* Allow player movement. 

Initially, I was working with Unity's hexagonal grid and tile palette, 
we eventually shifted over to displaying hexagonal models made with ProBuilder to ease our efforts later down the road for procedurally generating maps.
I researched the A* algorithm for pathfinding and assisted in paired programming for our technical demo. Additionally, I also

* Created a main menu for the game

Overall, I spent about 4 hours researching and 2 in development.

Positive:

We were able to nicely divide our team into roles of designers, programmers, and artists. The team was also eager to coordinate and share ideas with one other.

Negative: 

We ran into some issues getting everyone access to files with SourceTree, but found alternatives with GitHub Desktop and GitKraken.

Upcoming:

We'll be further delegating tasks as we go deeper into development.
