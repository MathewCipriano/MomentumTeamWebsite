### Week 10

Postmortem

Positive: 
1. A lot of us know beforehand on what tasks to do and choose specialization for the game to be completed
2. A good leader, Alex Ho, make it or break it in a group like this. Alex step up a lot in this project such as delegating tasks and keeping people in check with their work. It 
   had everything a lot easier and able to deliver deliverables on time.
3. Overall mood of everyone on the project. The postive moral and eagerness to bring the game to life promotes a good environment for everyone to work in. No one was negative
   and the happy mood of the group. 

Negative: 
1. The communication was a bit lacking in the beginning, but that is to be expected. Although, communication started to fall off as the time goes on.
2. For developers, the version control was pretty bad and it should be sorted out in the very beginning to speed up production.
3. Level designs should be key in mid production of the game, but since we are new as a group, level design was pushed to near the end and it can create an overrall better game
   if address sooner.
   
  Overrall the team did well, really well, but somethings should be address in the beginning such as communication and potential version control fixes. Although, most of these 
  complications can be fixed with just better communicaton. Like talking on your current progress and what expect to be done by what time.
