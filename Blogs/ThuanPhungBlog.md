## Welcome to Thuan Phung's Personal Production Journal

### Week 1
Tuan Phung PPJ 1

This week we delegated the week 3 deliverable amongst the team. I was delegated to work on the 1-page GDD. It was not as complicated, but we did need to verify a couple of miscommunications about the game and technology to use. We needed to know which version for our unity, the character design, board NxN value, and etc. 
Overall, the team is making progress and everyone is getting along. I look forward to working with everyone.
