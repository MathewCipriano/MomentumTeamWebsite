## Welcome to Alexander Ho's Personal Production Journal

### Week 2

Alexander Ho, PPJ 1

Tasks: 

1. Created the team website: 7 hours

2. Setup the blogs for PPJs: 1 hour

3. Built and hosted the tech demo on the team website: 1 hour

4. Defined clearer requirements and tasks for upcoming week: 3 hours

Total hours: 12

Positive: Everyone is very enthusiastic about the game, and I appreciate that immensly. People have completed the tasks I set out for them, and seemed to have organized well, even within the messy nature of the week. 

Negative: As I didn't have a huge amount of time between having my game chosen and distributing tasks and roles, it was a little difficult getting everything organized. Also managing and communicating with a large group can sometimes be difficult because not everyone is online at the same time. Its a lot easier to convey a message to one person than to nine. Also, learning how to host a github page the way I wanted was a little tricky but its going to be very useful for the future. 

Upcoming: Distribute development tasks. Complete development tasks. Create art for the game. Keep up with everyone's progress. 


### Week 3

Alexander Ho, PPJ 2

Tasks: 

1. GDD: 8 hours

2. Setting up presentation: 4 hour

3. Integrated classes that other team members created: 1

Total hours: 13

Positive: Everyone was able to deliver on their tasks which is amazing. The programmers made it very easy for me to use their code and integrate things together. Even when I haven't worked on the code as much as them, I can still have insight to whats going on, on the development side. The artist were able to deliver on good concepts, and a decent draft of the documentation actually got made. 

Negative: I was extremely busy with other work this week so it was stressful cramming a lot of the game design requirements. Also, its hard to work on game design and develop the game, and assign tasks in parallel. I want to create the base game first, which I feel is well defined, and then once everyone is comfrotable, actually take some time to define additional aspects of the game. I feel that a lot of the game design document additions I made are more temporary in nature as a result.  

Upcoming: Pass out development tasks. Start making art assets. Be more invovled in code development. Have a long form discussion with the team on the design of the game.
