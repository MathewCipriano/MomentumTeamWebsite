## Welcome to Alexander Ho's Personal Production Journal

### Week 2

Alexander Ho, PPJ 1

Tasks: 

1. Created the team website: 7 hours

2. Setup the blogs for PPJs: 1 hour

3. Built and hosted the tech demo on the team website: 1 hour

4. Defined clearer requirements and tasks for upcoming week: 3 hours

Total hours: 12

Positive: Everyone is very enthusiastic about the game, and I appreciate that immensly. People have completed the tasks I set out for them, and seemed to have organized well, even within the messy nature of the week. 

Negative: As I didn't have a huge amount of time between having my game chosen and distributing tasks and roles, it was a little difficult getting everything organized. Also managing and communicating with a large group can sometimes be difficult because not everyone is online at the same time. Its a lot easier to convey a message to one person than to nine. Also, learning how to host a github page the way I wanted was a little tricky but its going to be very useful for the future. 

Upcoming: Distribute development tasks. Complete development tasks. Create art for the game. Keep up with everyone's progress. 


### Week 3

Alexander Ho, PPJ 2

Tasks: 

1. GDD: 8 hours

2. Setting up presentation: 4 hour

3. Integrated classes that other team members created: 1

Total hours: 13

Positive: Everyone was able to deliver on their tasks which is amazing. The programmers made it very easy for me to use their code and integrate things together. Even when I haven't worked on the code as much as them, I can still have insight to whats going on, on the development side. The artist were able to deliver on good concepts, and a decent draft of the documentation actually got made. 

Negative: I was extremely busy with other work this week so it was stressful cramming a lot of the game design requirements. Also, its hard to work on game design and develop the game, and assign tasks in parallel. I want to create the base game first, which I feel is well defined, and then once everyone is comfrotable, actually take some time to define additional aspects of the game. I feel that a lot of the game design document additions I made are more temporary in nature as a result.  

Upcoming: Pass out development tasks. Start making art assets. Be more invovled in code development. Have a long form discussion with the team on the design of the game. 

### Week 4

Alexander Ho, PPJ 3

Tasks:

1. Player Controller: 3 hours

2. Grid Public Interface reference for team members: 3 hours

3. Basic Movement: 1 hour

4. Basic Damage: 1 hour

5. Basic Enemy movement: 1 hour

6. Indication Highlights: 3 hours

7. HUD: 30 minutes

8. Integrating Turns: 1 hour

9. Level Generation: 30 minutes

10. Team Design Meeting: 3 hours

Total Hours: 17

Positive: Its really good that we are able to actually get the major components and classes out of the way, because it was tricky developing this project while waiting on so many missing parts. In the end, a lot of major components were layed out and completed which is really good. Also, everyone has a very clear direction for the game now. 

Negative: Had to wait for a big component to be finished so I couldn't get the time to integrate all the the components that I created while using the square grid substitute. Also,  because the team has decided to pivot to a different foundaton of the game, the current state of the demo is not as representative of the actual game loop. Hoping to get a reprsentative example by next week. 

Upcoming: integrate compoonents with new hex grid class. Refine gameplay loop to reflect the team's new direction. Add visual assets to the game. 

### Week 5

Positive: Pair Programming has proven to be effective.

Negative: A lot of work to juggle this week, difficult to organize and distribute task to team members. 

Upcoming: finish integration and finish foundation.
