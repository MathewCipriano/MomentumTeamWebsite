Positive: Everyone is very enthusiastic about the game, and I appreciate that immensly. People have completed the tasks I set out for them, and seemed to have organized well, even within the messy nature of the week. 

Negative: As I didn't have a huge amount of time between having my game chosen and distributing tasks and roles, it was a little difficult getting everything organized. Also managing and communicating with a large group can sometimes be difficult because not everyone is online at the same time. Its a lot easier to convey a message to one person than to nine. Also, learning how to host a github page the way I wanted was a little tricky but its going to be very useful for the future. 

Upcoming: Distribute development tasks. Complete development tasks. Create art for the game. Keep up with everyone's progress.
